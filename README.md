# Flex Seal for Windows

This is a tool for "sealing" systems by protecting them from digital attacks. I made this in the hopes of demystifying cybersecurity operations for beginners and simplifying the process for experienced users. As captain of my CyberPatriots team, my tool allowed us to efficiently solve problems and ultimately have a successful first year.

CyberPatriots challenges teams to secure VMs that have many vulnerabilities. My experience in CyberPatriots founded my love for cybersecurity as a craft. As I find myself digging through folders, I come across mysterious files poking holes in firewalls, requiring tedious changes in access permissions. To me, challenges in cybersecurity present a puzzle. Sometimes, getting stuck and needing help is a blow to my ego. But, getting my hands dirty helps me appreciate the intricacy of the solution.

To make the command line interface for Flex Seal for Windows, I scoured Microsoft’s documentation for registry editing, shared file managers, and networking. Then, I used the Windows STIG from STIGViewer to learn about various vulnerabilities — from their registry hives, paths, to value names/types — with focus on CAT I and II severities. This was made at school with access to Windows 10 Pro and Server 2016 systems.
